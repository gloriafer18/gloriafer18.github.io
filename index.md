# Who am I?

My name is Gloria Milena Fernández Nieto, I am pasionate about data, analytics, and visualisations. My interest on technology and more specifically on how data can be useful to support others to make decisions or in general to support others practices grew up while I was doing my bachelor and during my master. Now as a Ph.D candidate I am fascinated to investigate how sensor-data can facilitate the provision of great tools to help teachers and students to reflect on their collocated (physical) activities (e.g. teamwork, collaboration, or spatial behaviours).

# About my research

Gloria received the B.S. degree in Telematics Engineering from Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas, Bogotá, Colombia, in 2011 and the M.S. degree in computer science from Universidad de Los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia, in 2015. She is currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Connected Intelligence Centre, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia. Her current research focuses on exploring alternatives of feedback to understand traces from data collected in the computer-supported collaborative learning classroom, with the goal of prompting reflection in teaching and learning practices. I enjoy working with sensor-data, visualisation, learning analytics and generally working with data in transdisciplinary fields.
