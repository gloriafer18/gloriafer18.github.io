## About my research

Gloria received the B.S. degree in Telematics Engineering from Universidad Distrital Francisco Jose de Caldas, Bogotá, Colombia, in 2011 and the M.S. degree in computer science from Universidad de Los Andes, Bogotá, Colombia, in 2015. She is currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Connected Intelligence Centre, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia. Her current research focuses on exploring alternatives of feedback to understand traces from data collected in the computer-supported collaborative learning classroom, with the goal of prompting reflection in teaching and learning practices. I enjoy working with sensor-data, visualisation, learning analytics and generally working with data in transdisciplinary fields.
