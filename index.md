# Who am I?

My name is Gloria Milena Fernández Nieto. I am originally from Bogotá, Colombia, and have a passion for data, analytics, and visualisations. My interest in using data to support others' practices grew during both my bachelor's and master's degrees. 
In 2023, I completed my PhD in Learning Analytics. I am fascinated by the potential of physical and online data traces that could be used to support a better understanding of learning/teaching activities. Data traces are valuable resources 
for teachers and students to identify insights and reflect on their co-located activities such as teamwork, collaboration, self-regulated learning, or spatial behaviours.

# Current work

I am a Research Fellow in the Faculty of Information Technology, [Monash University](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/gloria-fernandez-nieto), Australia. My current research focus on Knowledge Management Systems and how they can be design and implemented to support communities of practice of educators. This research is part of the project “Large-scale multimodal knowledge management: From organization and user modeling to fast contextual presentation” funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in the US (DARPA-KMASS).

I enjoy working with sensor-data, visualisation, learning analytics, and generally working with data in transdisciplinary fields. More information in: Teamwork Analytics

# About my research

I explore alternative feedback methods to analyse learner and educator digital/physical traces, aiming to stimulate reflection in teaching and learning practices. I leverage my expertise in human-computer interaction, collaborative learning, and 
artificial intelligence to design analytics dashboards, knowledge management systems, and data storytelling tools for regular classrooms and healthcare settings. Recently, I pioneered the application of co-design methods at the intersection of 
education and data science.
